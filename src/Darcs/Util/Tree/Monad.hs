-- | An experimental monadic interface to Tree mutation. The main idea is to
-- simulate IO-ish manipulation of real filesystem (that's the state part of
-- the monad), and to keep memory usage down by reasonably often dumping the
-- intermediate data to disk and forgetting it. The monad interface itself is
-- generic, and a number of actual implementations can be used. This module
-- provides just 'virtualTreeIO' that never writes any changes, but may trigger
-- filesystem reads as appropriate.

-- filesystem, however with 'plainTreeIO', the plain tree will be updated every
-- now and then, and with 'hashedTreeIO' a darcs-style hashed tree will get
-- updated.
