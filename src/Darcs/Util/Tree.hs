-- | Lay one tree over another. The resulting Tree will look like the base (1st

-- taken from the overlay. It is not allowed to overlay a different kind of an
-- object, nor it is allowed for the overlay to add new objects to base.  This
-- means that the overlay Tree should be a subset of the base Tree (although
-- any extraneous items will be ignored by the implementation).
