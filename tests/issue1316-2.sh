# this test is a slightly more complicated variant on failing-issue1316
# it also uses darcs commands to test rather than grepping pending.

. lib                           # Load some portability helpers.

rm -rf R
darcs init      --repo R        # Create our test repos.

cd R

touch X
darcs rec -lam 'X'

darcs mv X Y
darcs rec -am 'Y'

rm Y
echo 'y' | darcs amend -a

# the bug is that addfile Y shows up in pending
# if pending is empty as it should be, then since
# whatsnew doesn't have -l, it shouldn't report anything
# even after we touch Y.
touch Y
not darcs whatsnew
