# Colons could be in repo names and in file name.
# Colon in repo name is an indication of special case - remote repo.
# Colon in the file could be there under unix and requires no special treatment.

# remote repos are tested by tests/network/issue1932-remote.sh

# All following files should not be added unless "--reserved-ok" is specified,
# but should be added with "--reserved-ok" just fine
